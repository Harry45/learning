## Use of PyTorch Lightning with CIFAR10

This is an implementation of the tutorial found [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/lightning_examples/cifar10-baseline.html).

Important libraries required include:

-   PyTorch Lightning
-   Lightning Bolts
-   TorchMetrics

and can be installed as follows:

```
pip install ightning-bolts
```

and it will install all the other libraries as well.

We can run the code with the following:

```
python main.py --config=config.py
```
